          <p>A steady April rain was soaking the earth. It hadn't been bad 
to drive through until dusk came. In the half-light it was hard 
to see the road. The rain was heavy enough to reflect my 
headlights back against the wind-shield. My mileage on the 
speedometer told me I couldn't be very far from Hillston.</p>

<p>When I saw the motel sign ahead on the right I slowed down. 
It looked fairly new. I turned in. The parking area was paved 
with those round brown pebbles that crunch under the tires. I 
parked as close to the office as I could get and ran from the 
car into the office. A woman with the bright cold eyes and 
thin sharp movements of a water bird rented me a room far 
back from the highway sound. She said the place was just 
four miles from the Hillston city limits.</p>

Once I saw the room I decided that it would do. It would be a 
good place to stay while I did what had to be done in 
Hillston. I stretched out on the bed and wondered if I had 
been smart to use my right name on the motel register. But if 
I could find the money, there would be no one to say that I 
was the one who had taken it. And using my right name 
wouldn't make any difference at all.

When at last the rain eased up I went and found a small 
roadside restaurant. The girl behind the counter told me 
where I could buy a bottle of liquor. She seemed open to any 
invitation to help me drink it up, but though she was 
reasonably pretty I was not interested. I had this other thing 
on my mind and I wanted to go back alone and have some 
drinks and think about it and wonder how I could do it.

Maybe you saw pictures of us, the ones who were really bad 
off when the prisoners were exchanged. I was one of the litter 
cases. My stomach had stopped digesting the slop they fed 
us, and I was down to ninety-three pounds. One more week 
and I would have been buried up there beyond the river like 
so many others were. I was in bad shape. Not only physically 
but mentally. I was too sick to be flown back. Memory was all 
shot. I went right into hospital and they started feeding me 
through a tube.

It was during the months in the military hospital back in this 
country that I began to sort things out and began to 
remember more of the details about Timmy Warden of 
Hillston. When the intelligence people had interrogated me I 
had told them how Timmy died but nothing more than that. I 
didn't tell them any of the stuff Timmy had told me.

We were both captured at the same time in that action near 
the reservoir. I'd known him casually. He was in a different 
platoon. We were together most of the time after we were 
captured. Enough has already been written about how it was. 
It wasn't good.

That prison camp experience can change your attitude 
toward life and toward yourself. It did that to Timmy Warden. 
His one thought was to survive. It was that way with all of us, 
but Timmy seemed more of a fanatic than anybody else. He 
had to get back.

He told me about it one night. That was after he'd gotten 
pretty weak. I was still in fair shape. He told me about it in the 
dark, whispering to me. I couldn't see his face.

"Tal, I've got to get back and straighten something out. I've 
got to. Every time I think about it I'm ashamed. I thought I 
was being smart. I thought I was getting what I wanted. 
Maybe I've grown up now. I've got to get it straightened out."

"What was it you wanted?"

"I wanted it and I got it, but I can't use it now. I wanted her 
too, and had her, but she's no good to me now."

"I'm not following this so good, Timmy."

He told me the story then. He had been in business with his 
brother George Warden. George was older by six years. 
George took him in as a partner. George had a flair for 
salesmanship and promotion. Timmy was good on the books, 
as he had a natural knack for figure work. They had a building 
supply business, a retail hardware outlet, a lumberyard, and 
several concrete trucks.

And George had a lush, petulant, amoral, discontented young 
wife named Eloise.

"I didn't make any play for her, Tal. It just seemed to happen. 
She was my brother's wife and I knew it was bad, but I 
couldn't stop. We had to sneak around behind his back. 
Hillston isn't a very big city. We had to be very careful. I 
guess I knew all the time what she was. But George thought 
she was the best thing that ever walked. She was the one 
who talked me into running away with her, Tal. She was the 
one who said we'd have to have money. So I started to 
steal."

He told me how he did it. A lot of the gimmicks didn't make 
much sense to me. He did all the ordering, handled the bank 
accounts and deposits. It was a big and profitable operation. 
He took a little bit here, a little bit there, always in cash. All 
the time he was doing it he was carrying on the affair with 
Eloise. He said it took nearly two years to squirrel away 
almost sixty thousand dollars. The auditors didn't catch it.

"I couldn't open a bank account with the money, and I knew 
better than to put it in a safety-deposit box. I put the money 
in those old-fashioned jars. The kind with the red rubber 
washer and the wire that clamps the top on. I'd fill them and 
bury them. George kept worrying about why we weren't 
making more money. I kept lying to him. Eloise was getting 
more restless all the time and more careless. I was afraid 
George would find out, and I didn't know what he'd do. She 
had me sort of hypnotized. We finally set the date when we 
were going to run away. Everything was planned. And then 
they called me up. I was reserve. There wasn't a damn thing I 
could do about it. I told Eloise that when I got out we'd go 
through with it the way we planned. But now I'm stuck here. 
And now I don't want to go through with it. I want to get back 
there and give the money back to George and tell him the 
whole thing. I've had too much chance to think it over."

"How do you know she hasn't taken the money and left?"

"I didn't tell her where I put it. It's still there. Nobody can find 
it."

His story gave me a lot to think about. Timmy Warden sank 
lower and lower. By that time those of us who were left alive 
had become expert on how long the dying would last. And I 
knew that Timmy was one of the dying. I knew he'd never 
leave there alive. I tried to find out where the money was 
buried. But I'd waited a little too long. He was out of his head. 
I listened to him rave. I listened to every word he said.

But in his raving he never gave away the hiding place. It was 
in a moment of relative lucidity that he told me. It was 
afternoon and he caught my wrist with his wasted hand. "I'm 
not going to make it, Tal."

"You'll make it."

"No. You go back there and straighten it out. You can do that. 
Tell George. Give him the money. Tell him everything."

"Sure. Where is the money?"

"Tell him everything."

"Where's the money hidden?"

"Cindy would know," he said, suddenly breathless with weak, 
crazy laughter. "Cindy would know." And that's all I could get 
out of him. I was still strong enough then to use a shovel. I 
helped dig the hole for Timmy Warden that night.

Back in the stateside hospital I thought about that sixty 
thousand dollars. I could see those fruit jars with the tight 
rolls of bills inside the glass. I would dig them out and rub the 
dirt off and see the green gleam of the money. It helped pass 
the time in the hospital.

Finally they let me out. The thought of the money was no 
longer on the surface of my mind. It was hidden down 
underneath. I would think about it, but not very often. I went 
back to my job. It seemed pretty tasteless to me. I felt 
restless and out of place. I'd used up a lot of emotional 
energy in order to stay alive and come back to this, back to 
my job and back to Charlotte, the girl I had planned to marry. 
Now that I was back neither job nor girl seemed enough.

Two weeks ago they let me go. I don't blame them. I'd been 
doing my job in a listless way. I told Charlotte I was going 
away for a while. Her tears left me completely untouched. 
She was just a girl crying, a stranger. I told her I didn't know 
where I was going. But I knew I was going to Hillston. The 
money was there. And somebody named Cindy who would 
know how to find it.

I had started the long trip with an entirely unrealistic 
anticipation of success. Now I was not so confident. It 
seemed that I was searching for more than the sixty thousand 
dollars. It seemed to me that I was looking for some meaning 
or significance to my life. I had a thousand dollars in 
traveler's checks and everything I owned with me. Everything 
I owned filled two suitcases.

Charlotte had wept, and it hadn't touched me. I had 
accepted being fired without any special interest. Ever since 
the repatriation, since the hospital, I had felt like half a man. It 
was as though the other half of me had been buried and I 
was coming to look for it—here in Hillston, a small city I had 
never seen. Somehow I had to begin to live again. I had 
stopped living in a prison camp. And never come completely 
to life again.

I drank in the motel room until my lips felt numb. There was a 
pay phone in the motel office. The bird woman looked at me 
with obvious disapproval but condescended to change three 
ones into change for the phone.

I had forgotten the time difference. Charlotte was having 
dinner with her people. Her mother answered the phone. I 
heard the coldness in her mother's voice. She called 
Charlotte.

"Tal? Tal, where are you?"

"A place called Hillston."

"Are you all right? You sound so strange."

"I'm okay."

"What are you doing? Are you looking for a job?"

"Not yet."

She lowered her voice so I could barely hear her. "Do you 
want me to come there? I would, you know, if you want me. 
And no—no strings, Tal darling."

"No. I just called so you'd know I'm all right."

"Thank you for calling, darling."

"Well ... good-by."

"Please write to me."

I promised and hung up and went back to my room. I wanted 
things to be the way they had once been between us. I did 
not want to hurt her. I did not want to hurt myself. But I felt as 
if a whole area in my mind was dead and numb. The part 
where she had once been. She had been loyal while I had 
been gone. She was the one who had the faith I would return. 
She did not deserve this.

On the following morning, Thursday morning, Hillston lay 
clean and washed by the night rains, bright and glowing in 
the April sunshine. Timmy had often talked about the city.

"It's more town than city. There isn't much of a transient 
population. Everybody seems to know everybody. It's a pretty 
good place, Tal."

It lay amid gentle hills, and the town stretched north-south, 
following the line of Harts River. I drove up the main street, 
Delaware Street. Traffic had outgrown the narrowness of the 
street. Standardization had given most of our small cities the 
same look. Plastic and glass brick store fronts. Woolworth's 
and J. C. Penney and Liggett and Timely and the chain 
grocery. The essential character of Hillston had been watered 
down by this standardization and yet there was more 
individuality left than in many other cities. Here was a flavor 
of leisure, of mild manners and quiet pleasures. No major 
highway touched the city. It was in an eddy apart from the 
great current.

Doubtless there were many who complained acidly about the 
town being dead on its feet, about the young people leaving 
for greater opportunities. But such human irritants did not 
change the rather smug complacency of the city. The 
population was twenty-five thousand and Timmy had told me 
that it had not changed very much in the past twenty years. 
There was the pipe mill and a small electronics industry and a 
plant that made cheap hand tools. But the money in town 
was the result of its being a shopping center for all the 
surrounding farmland.

I had crossed the country as fast as I could, taking it out on 
the car, anxious to get to this place. The car kept stalling as I 
stopped for the lights on Delaware Street. When I spotted a 
repair garage I turned in.

A man came up to me as I got out of the car. "I think I need a 
tune-up. It keeps stalling. And a grease job and oil change."

He looked at the wall clock. "About three this afternoon be 
okay?"

"That'll be all right."

"California plates. On your way through?"

"Just on a vacation. I stopped here because I used to know a 
fellow from this town. Timmy Warden."

He was a gaunt man with prematurely white hair and bad 
teeth. He picked a cigarette out of the top pocket of his 
coveralls. "Knew Timmy, did you? The way you say it, I guess 
you know he's dead."

"Yes. I was with him when he died."

"There in the camp, eh? Guess it was pretty rough."

"It was rough. He used to talk about this place. And about his 
brother George. I thought I'd stop and maybe see his brother 
and tell him about how it was with Timmy."

The man spat on the garage floor. "I guess George knows 
how it was."

"I don't understand."

"There's another man came here from that camp. Matter of 
fact he's still here. Came here a year ago. Name of Fitzmartin. 
Earl Fitzmartin. He works for George at the lumberyard. 
Guess you'd know him, wouldn't you?"

"I know him," I said.
